Smart Blind Stick with Voice Alerts and Sensors
Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to design a smart blind stick that assists visually impaired individuals by providing guidance and alerts for obstacles, manholes, and water. It incorporates various sensors and a voice module to enhance safety and usability.

Components
Microcontroller Control System: Manages the overall operation of the smart blind stick.
Voice Module: Stores and plays back recorded voice alerts, replacing traditional alarm systems.
Sensors:
Obstacle Detection Sensor: Uses IR transmitter and receiver to detect obstacles in the path.
Water Sensor: Detects water to alert the user of wet surfaces.
Manhole Detection Sensor: Alerts the user when near a manhole.
Functionality
Obstacle Detection: Continuously emits IR rays and detects disruptions caused by obstacles. Alerts are generated if obstacles are detected.
Manhole and Water Detection: Sensors detect manholes and water, triggering immediate alerts to the user.
Voice Alerts: Alerts and instructions are conveyed through the voice module, enhancing user interaction and safety.
Advantages
Enhanced Safety: Provides real-time alerts for obstacles, manholes, and water, improving user safety during navigation.
User-Friendly: Voice-based alerts and guidance are intuitive and accessible for visually impaired individuals.
Modern Technology Integration: Replaces traditional alarm systems with voice-configurable alerts, making the device versatile and user-customizable.
Conclusion
The smart blind stick with voice alerts and sensors aims to significantly improve the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. It integrates advanced sensors and voice technology to provide proactive alerts and guidance, ensuring a secure navigation experience.
